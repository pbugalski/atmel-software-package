/**
 * \file
 *
 * \par Purpose
 *
 * This module provides several definitions and methods for using an USART
 * peripheral.
 *
 * \par Usage
 *
 * -# Enable the USART peripheral clock in the PMC.
 * -# Enable the required USART PIOs (see pio.h).
 * -# Configure the UART by calling USART_Configure.
 * -# Enable the transmitter and/or the receiver of the USART using
 *    USART_SetTransmitterEnabled and USART_SetReceiverEnabled.
 * -# Send data through the USART using the USART_Write methods.
 * -# Receive data from the USART using the USART_Read functions; the availability of data can be polled
 *    with USART_IsDataAvailable.
 * -# Disable the transmitter and/or the receiver of the USART with
 *    USART_SetTransmitterEnabled and USART_SetReceiverEnabled.
